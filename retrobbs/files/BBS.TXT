A bulletin board system or BBS is a computer server running software 
that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. 

Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and 
downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging 
messages with other users through public message boards and sometimes 
via direct chatting. 

In the early days, message aggregators and bulk store-and-forward'ers 
provided services such as FidoNet, which is similar to email.
